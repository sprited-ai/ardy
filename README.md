ARDY is an autoregressive diffusion model designed for interactive motion generation, supporting online text prompting and flexible long-horizon kinematic constraints (root paths/waypoints, full-body keyframes, and sparse joint positions/rotations) with real-time responsiveness.

This repo provides code, checkpoints, and demos to work with the pre-trained ARDY models introduced in the [SIGGRAPH paper](https://research.nvidia.com/labs/sil/projects/ardy/).

## Setup
> This repo has mainly been tested on Ubuntu Linux 22.04 with RTX 4090, nvidia-driver-575, and Python 3.11.

In a fresh Python 3.10+ environment (conda or venv), first install a build of **PyTorch** (>= 2.4) that matches your machine's CUDA, then install ARDY in editable mode with all optional features:

```bash
conda create -n ardy python=3.11 -y
conda activate ardy
# Install PyTorch for your CUDA version first — see https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/
# For example:
pip install torch torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu126
pip install -e ".[all]"
```

<details>
<summary>Install details: why PyTorch first, build requirements, and partial installs</summary>

- **Why install PyTorch first:** ARDY only requires `torch>=2.4`, so installing PyTorch yourself first lets you pick the CUDA build that matches your GPU/driver. The ARDY install then keeps the compatible PyTorch you already have rather than pulling a default wheel.
- **Build requirements:** the install builds the bundled motion-correction C++ extension, which requires CMake >= 3.15 and a C++17 compiler (`sudo apt install cmake build-essential` on Ubuntu).
- **Partial installs:** the optional dependency groups can also be installed individually:
  - `pip install -e .` — core model inference only
  - `pip install -e ".[demo]"` — adds the interactive demo (viser, gradio)
  - `pip install -e ".[trt]"` — adds TensorRT acceleration
- **TensorRT requirements:** the `[trt]` extra requires an NVIDIA driver >= 525 (CUDA 12-capable — the CUDA runtime itself is bundled via pip) and access to `pypi.nvidia.com` during install. On setups that don't meet these requirements, install `.[demo]` instead and select a non-TensorRT acceleration mode in the demo.

### Set up Hugging Face token for text encoder

The text encoder relies on the gated [meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct) model, which requires:

- Your Hugging Face account has been granted access to the model page.
- You provide a Hugging Face token at runtime.

After you receive access to the Llama repo, create an access token in [Hugging Face token settings](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens), then either log in on the command line:

```bash
hf auth login
```

or paste the token in `~/.cache/huggingface/token`. If you do not have `hf` installed, install it first:

```bash
pip install --upgrade huggingface_hub
```

### Checkpoints

ARDY checkpoints are available trained on various skeletons with differing FPS and prediction horizon length.

> Note: models will be downloaded automatically when used in the demo, so there is no need to download them manually

| Model | Skeleton | Training Data | FPS | Horizon | Release Date | Hugging Face | License |

**Coming soon!** We are working to train a version of ARDY on Rigplay 1 with the [SOMA body model](https://github.com/NVlabs/SOMA-X) skeleton.

### [Optional] Dataset

Downloading data is only required for running the kinematically constrained generation demos.

**Bones SEED motion data**:
The kinematically constrained generation demo samples constraints from motion sequences in the [Bones SEED](https://huggingface.co/datasets/bones-studio/seed) dataset. The motion data are provided in CSV format for G1. Corresponding text descriptions are retrieved from the metadata CSV during sampling.

Please download the Bones SEED dataset and put them under the `datasets/bones-seed/` directory in the root of the repo. The directory structure should be as follows:
```
datasets/bones-seed/
  g1/csv/
  metadata/
    seed_metadata_v004.csv
```

### Apple Silicon (macOS, MPS)

ARDY also runs on Apple Silicon Macs through PyTorch's MPS backend, including 16 GB machines. Everything
except the text encoder works out of the box; the text encoder (LLM2Vec on Llama-3-8B, 16 GB in bf16)
does not fit next to macOS on 16 GB, so it is run from a one-time, LoRA-merged **int4** checkpoint
(~5 GB) using PyTorch's built-in weight-only int4 kernels (no extra dependencies).

```bash
# Python 3.12 venv (uv or plain venv); the macOS arm64 torch wheel already includes MPS.
uv venv --python 3.12 .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install "torch>=2.10" pybind11
# CMake 4 needs this for the pinned pybind11/Eigen versions fetched by the C++ extension build.
CMAKE_POLICY_VERSION_MINIMUM=3.5 uv pip install -e ".[demo]"     # no [trt]: TensorRT is NVIDIA-only

# One-time (~5 min after the 16 GB Llama download; needs Llama-3 access on your HF account, see above):
# merges the two LLM2Vec LoRA adapters into the base weights and writes the int4 checkpoint to
# ~/.cache/ardy/text_encoders/LLM2Vec-Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct-int4 (~4.4 GB). The 16 GB download
# in ~/.cache/huggingface can be deleted afterwards.
python scripts/merge_llm2vec_lora.py

python scripts/generate.py "A person walks in a circle."     # picks mps + the int4 encoder automatically
python scripts/run_demo.py --no-compile                      # interactive demo (no TensorRT / torch.compile)
```

<details>
<summary>Details, numbers and knobs</summary>

- **Device selection:** `ardy.tools.get_default_device()` returns `cuda` > `mps` > `cpu`; override with
  `ARDY_DEVICE=cpu`. The demo's *Text Encoder* dropdown gains `mps / float16` entries.
- **Text encoder presets:** on MPS `load_text_encoder()` defaults to the local `llm2vec-int4` checkpoint
  (then `llm2vec-int8` if that is the only one built). `TEXT_ENCODER=llm2vec` forces the original HF/PEFT
  pipeline (needs ~20 GB of memory). `scripts/merge_llm2vec_lora.py --quantize int4 int8` also writes the
  ~8 GB int8 variant (near-lossless reference), `--quantize none` the plain merged 16 GB model.
- **Quantization:** weight-only, group size 64, asymmetric with MSE-optimal clipping, computed with
  `torch._weight_int4pack_mm` (MPS/CUDA) or a dequantize fallback (CPU). Embeddings and norms stay fp16.
  See `ardy/model/llm2vec/quantized.py`. Encoding a prompt takes ~0.3-0.9 s on an M1 Pro; the demo caches
  embeddings on disk, so presets are encoded once.
- **Memory (M1 Pro 16 GB):** int4 encoder ~5.6 GB + ARDY-Core model ~1 GB of MPS memory. MPS limits one
  process to about two thirds of unified memory (`torch.mps.recommended_max_memory()`), which is why int8
  (~9 GB) is only comfortable when nothing else is loaded.
- **Speed (M1 Pro, 10 denoising steps):** one autoregressive window costs ~0.29 s on MPS (~0.8 s on CPU):
  ~6.8x real time for the Horizon40 models (40 frames = 2 s of motion per window) and ~1.4x real time for
  the Horizon8 models (8 frames = 0.4 s per window). The interactive demo runs at its native 20 fps with
  ARDY-Core-Horizon40. The MPS path is latency-bound (many small kernels), which is why the generation loop
  avoids host syncs: no boolean-mask gathers, cached diffusion schedule / guidance weights, normalization
  stats kept on the device, and the positional-encoding range assert is opt-in (`ARDY_CHECK_PE_INDEX=1`).
  These changes are numerically neutral (bit-identical on CPU; MPS matches CPU to ~1e-5).
- **Not available on macOS:** TensorRT (`[trt]` extra, *ONNX-TRT* acceleration modes). Keep the demo's
  *Acceleration* dropdown on `None` (`--no-compile`): `torch.compile` (inductor) does run on MPS with
  torch 2.10 but was 2x slower than eager here and its output diverged from eager, so it is not used.
  transformers' `MetalConfig` quantizer was tried but its prebuilt Metal kernels fail to create pipelines on
  macOS 15 (and only ship for torch 2.8-2.10).
- `PYTORCH_ENABLE_MPS_FALLBACK=1` is not required; all ops used at inference have MPS kernels.
- **Browser note:** if the demo page loads but the viewport never connects (server log shows
  `websockets ... line too long`), open `http://127.0.0.1:2333` instead of `localhost`: a large cookie jar on
  `localhost` can push the websocket handshake over the 8 KB header limit.
- **Encoder fidelity:** int4 embeddings have cosine similarity ~0.98 to the int8 (near-lossless) ones.
  `TEXT_ENCODER=llm2vec-int8` is a drop-in higher-fidelity option when ~9 GB of MPS memory is free.

## Interactive Demo

We provide an interactive demo that enables real-time humanoid character control through a combination of streaming text prompts and interactive spatial constraints. Below are some features of the interactive demo:

- Online motion generation visualized in web browser viewport
- Streaming text-to-motion
- Kinematically constrained motion generation (full body keyframes, root trajectory and waypoints, end-effector joints)
- Mouse and keyboard-based locomotion controls

### Launch Interactive Demo

```bash
python scripts/run_demo.py
```

If you plan to be frequently re-launching the demo, it can be helpful to launch the text encoder API service in the background. This way, the demo will not need to instantiate the text encoder every time it is launched. In a separate terminal, run:
```bash
python scripts/run_text_encoder_server.py
```

### Quick Start
- **Open the UI**: In your browser, go to `http://localhost:2333`. You can use Left-drag to rotate, Right-drag to pan, and Scroll to zoom to control the camera with mouse.
- **Load a model**: Choose a checkpoint from the **Model Directory** dropdown in the **Model** tab and click **Load Model**. The first load may take a few minutes if TensorRT compilation is enabled. A default checkpoint is loaded if no checkpoint is manually selected.
- **Start playback**: Press `Space` key or click **Play** button to start/stop playing the motion.
- **Text prompts**: Either click a preset in **Prompt List**, or type your own in **Prompt Text** and click **Update Text Prompt**.
- **Mouse-based locomotion control**: Press `p` to enable waypoint mode (or click the **Enable Waypoint Mode** checkbox in the **Waypoint** folder under **Generate** tab), then click in the viewport to place waypoints for locomotion control.
- **Keyboard-based velocity control**: Press `t` key to enable target-velocity control. Use arrow keys to steer: left/right rotate the direction; up/down increase or decrease the speed.
- **Kinematic constraints**: Press `z` key to sample kinematic constraints from a dataset sequence specified in **Motion file path** (in the **Constraints** folder under **Generate** tab). Use the constraint-type checkboxes to control which categories are sampled.
- **Export/load sessions**: Use the **IO** tab for basic export/load of constraints and motion.

More detailed information about the interactive demo is available in the [GUI Reference](#gui-reference) section.

- **Native FPS** - The motion FPS of the loaded model.
- **Enable Auto-Replan** - If disabled, motion will not be automatically generated and stop at the last generated frame.

#### Tab: Text

- **Prompt List** - Preset prompt buttons containing example prompts. Clicking directly updates the active text prompt and embedding. You can select the text prompts on the fly and can also input your own text prompt using the **Prompt Text** field.
- **Prompt Text** - Enter a text prompt here; it will not take effect until the Update button is clicked.
- **Update Text Prompt** - Click to update the active text prompt and embedding.

#### Tab: Generate

- **Restart** - Clear all motion and restart generation from the first frame.
- **Restart From Now** - Clear motion after current frame and continue generation from the current frame.
- **Clear All Constraints** - Clear all kinematic constraints.
- **Initial Body Transform** - A gizmo to control initial root position and orientation.
- **Constraints**
  - Motion file path: path to a CSV (G1) motion file from `datasets/bones-seed/`. The kinematic constraints will be sampled from this motion file.
  - Random Motion File button: pick a random motion file from `datasets/bones-seed/` matching the loaded skeleton and populate the Motion file path field.
  - Crop to 10s: if enabled, randomly crop the loaded motion to 10 seconds if the motion is longer than 10 seconds.
  - Constraints types checkboxes [full body, hands, feet, hands+feet, 2D waypoints, 2D trajectory]: if enabled, sample constraints for the selected category.
  - Max keyframe number: maximum number of keyframe constraints allowed for sampling
  - Continue from current frame: if enabled, sample new constraints without restarting; otherwise clear motion history before generation.
  - Sample Constraints button (hotkey: `z`): If pressed, the kinematic constraints will be sampled from the specified motion file. Note that the kinematic constraints sampling only supports the G1 skeleton which is included in the Bones Seed dataset.
- **Waypoint** (mouse-based locomotion control)
  - Waypoint mode (hotkey: `p`): toggle mouse-click-based waypoint control mode
  - Dense root: if enabled, use interpolation to generate dense trajectory constraints from waypoints
  - Waypoint interval: time interval between current frame and the waypoint keyframe, measured in number of frames.
- **Target Velocity** (keyboard-based velocity control; works better with the **Over-the-shoulder** auto camera enabled)
  - Enable checkbox: enable target velocity control.
  - Target root velocity: target root velocity in XZ plane.
  - Use target heading: if enabled, use root position + orientation as constraints; if disabled, only use root position as constraints.
- **Post Process**
  - Enable Post-Processing: apply optional motion correction to reduce foot skating and improve constraint following (slower; disabled by default).
  - Root Margin: margin for root position correction.
  - Contact Threshold: threshold for foot contact detection.

#### Tab: Visualize

- **Show Foot Contacts** - Color the foot joints purple on frames where the model predicts the foot to be in contact with the ground. Only visible when **Show Skeleton** is enabled.
- **Show Hand+Foot Orientations** - Overlay rotation-axis gizmos on the hand/wrist and foot joints, for both the generated motion and any end-effector keyframes in the timeline. Useful for verifying that orientation constraints are being followed.
- **Show Reference Motion** - Display the reference motion specified in **Motion file path** as a red semi-transparent mesh character
- **Hide Distant Constraints** - If enabled, constraints outside the future cropping range specified in **Future Crop Length** are hidden
- **Auto Camera** - A dropdown list to select from three auto camera types that updates according to current frame's human body pose.

#### Tab: Model

- **Acceleration Mode** - Choose TensorRT, torch.compile, or none
- **Text Encoder** - Set device + precision for the LLM2Vec text encoder. Options: `cuda / bfloat16` (default, fastest, ~14 GB VRAM), `cuda / float32` (VRAM demanding), `cpu / bfloat16`, `cpu / float32` (slower prompt encoding but requires less VRAM).
- **TRT Export Settings** - Min/opt/max tokens and export button. These settings are used to configure the exportation of the TensorRT engines for the denoiser and decoder and may slightly affect the generation speed.
- **History Crop Length** - Maximum number of history frames input to the model (min: patch size, max: FPS x 10s - generation horizon, step size: patch size, default: min). Smaller history crop length facilitates faster adaptation to new prompts and kinematic constraints, while larger history crop length allows for longer context which helps complex semantic motion generation and smoother transitions.
- **Future Crop Length** - Number of future frames beyond generation horizon for constraint input (min: 0, max: FPS x 10s - generation horizon, step size: patch size, default: max)
- **Replan Buffer Size** - How many frames of replan buffer to use. Ensure that the generation time is less than the (replan buffer + 1) frames playback time.
- **Replan Trigger Threshold** - When remaining generated-but-unplayed frames <= this threshold, trigger replan.

#### Tab: IO

- **Session Export/Load** - Export/load the full session (motion and/or constraints) to/from a file.
- **Root Constraints** - Load/save root constraints to a file.
- **Scene** - Load a scene file and adjust mesh transform/translation.
- **Capture Viewport Image** - Capture the current viewport image and save it to a file.

### Model Integration in Demo

The interactive demo is a good reference for how ARDY can be used autoregressively for realtime applications. The key entry points are:

- **Loading:** [`load_model()`](ardy/model/load_model.py) resolves a checkpoint, builds the model, and attaches the LLM2Vec text encoder (built separately via `load_text_encoder()` so it can be reused across models). Models are referenced by nickname — a skeleton name (`"core"`, `"g1"`, `"soma"`, resolving to that skeleton's default horizon) or skeleton+horizon (`"core8"`, `"g152"`, `"soma60"`) — or by full name (`"ARDY-Core-RP-20FPS-Horizon40"`); see [`ardy/model/registry.py`](ardy/model/registry.py). The demo wires this up in [`ModelLoadingMixin.load_model`](scripts/interactive_demo/loading.py).
- **Generation:** the model runs autoregressively via [`Ardy.autoregressive_step()`](ardy/model/ardy_model.py) — text embeddings and optional kinematic constraints (`motion_mask`/`observed_motion`) in, motion frames out. See it called each step in [`GenerationMixin._generate_step`](scripts/interactive_demo/generation.py), which shows how to encode the text prompt, assemble history + constraint masks, and decode the output back to joint positions with `motion_rep.inverse(...)`.

---

## Command-Line Generation

For non-interactive / batch generation, [`scripts/generate.py`](scripts/generate.py) generates motion from a text prompt and writes it to disk (`.npz`; plus a MuJoCo-qpos `.csv` for G1). Generated files are written to the `outputs/` folder by default.

```bash
# Simplest: 5s of motion with the default model, written to outputs/output.npz
python scripts/generate.py "A person walks in a circle."

# Choose a model + length, and fix the seed for reproducible output (writes outputs/jump.npz)
python scripts/generate.py "A person jumps." --model core --duration 8.0 --seed 0 --output jump

# Multiple samples (writes a folder outputs/waves/ with waves_00.npz, waves_01.npz, ...)
python scripts/generate.py "A person waves." --model g1 --num_samples 4 --output waves
```

Each `.npz` contains the generated motion — `posed_joints` (world-space joint positions, `[T, J, 3]`), local/global joint rotations, root positions, and foot contacts — plus the `fps` and the prompt `text`.

To play back a generated motion in the browser (same viser viewport as the interactive demo), use [`scripts/visualize.py`](scripts/visualize.py):

```bash
python scripts/visualize.py outputs/output.npz   # single file
python scripts/visualize.py outputs/waves        # folder written with --num_samples > 1
```

then open `http://localhost:2334`. The skeleton (core / g1 / soma) is detected from the file; the viewer offers play/pause, a frame slider, mesh/skeleton toggles, and a sample dropdown for multi-sample folders.

Most useful flags:

| Flag | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `--model` | Model nickname `core`/`g1` (optionally with horizon, e.g. `core8`) or full folder name. Default: `core`. |
| `--duration` | Length in seconds (default 5.0). |
| `--num_samples` | Number of samples; when >1, writes a numbered folder. |
| `--seed` | Fix the random seed for reproducible output. |
| `--output` | Output stem (single sample → one file; multiple → a folder). Bare names go under `outputs/`; pass a path (e.g. `results/jump`) to write elsewhere. |
| `--history_frames` | History visible to each autoregressive step. Default: the longest history fitting the model's trained 10s window — keep it unless you want faster prompt adaptation. |
| `--constraints` | Path to a saved kinematic-constraint list. |
| `--no-postprocess` | Don't apply motion post-processing to reduce foot skating and hit constraints. |

> Tip: if you generate repeatedly, start the standalone text-encoder service in the background first (`python scripts/run_text_encoder_server.py`) so each run connects to it instead of loading the LLM2Vec model in-process every time.
